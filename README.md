# BK2034_GPIB
Tools for controlling a Bruel &amp; Kjaer 2034 via the GPIB (IEEE488) bus

You must have a National Instrument GPIB IEEE488 interface (mine is a NI GPIB-USB-HS) with the drivers installed in your system.
The utilities have been developed and tested with MacOSX 10.6.9 and 10.9.5 with the National Instruments IEEE488 framework.
